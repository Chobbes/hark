Hark is a simple program for automatic grading of student submitted programs.

* Introduction
  The main purpose of Hark is to automatically run student solutions,
  and compare the output of the student programs to the output of a
  solution.

  Hark will generate a summary file for each submission noting which
  tests were passed, which were failed, and totalling up the number of
  passed tests. Each test can be assigned a different weight.

  It is also possible to run tests without comparing the output to
  that of the solution script. This can be useful for testing
  something which can not be automatically graded. The expected output
  could be different depending upon the solution, for instance. While
  these tests may not be able to be graded automatically it may still
  be useful to collect their output. If the output of these tests is
  collected it can be much easier for the grader to check the results.
